4 - place an atomic stopwatch app (atomic clock for example) in front of your camera, start the script, press enter and you will get a screenshot and preview



This was written to be executed on macOS, I made some quick fixes to make it run on Windows and Linux as well, but havenâ€™t tested it, so let me know if you have issues
